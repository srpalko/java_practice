# per_scholas_java_practice

This is a collection of short Java programs written with the intention of practicing
Java basics. Most of them should be self-explanatory. The packages named for a chapter 
refer to the book "Introduction to Java Programming" by Y. Daniel Liang. The classes
in each package are solutions to problems in that chapter of the book. Other packages
starting with "ps" are collections of exercises from the Per Scholas Java Developer 
bootcamp.
